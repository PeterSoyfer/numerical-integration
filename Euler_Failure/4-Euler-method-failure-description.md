'Euler-method-failure.cpp' represents the aforementioned peculiarities that should warn one from using it even for simple problems like solving classical oscillator
ODE system: $\dot{x} = z,\quad \dot{z} = -x,\quad x(0)=0 , \quad z(0)=1$ . For proving this claim I obtained a table of the divergency values for numerical and analytical
solution for various periods of time $T = 2\pi, 10\pi, \dots , 10^5 \pi$ and steps $h = 0.1, 0.01, 0.001$ . Furthermore, these tables were used for plotting the graphs of
the actual values to have an obvious example of the stiff divergency. It was quite an amusement, I would say. Have a look and enjoy the power of Maths! :)
