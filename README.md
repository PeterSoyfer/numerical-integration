# Numerical Integration and Optimisation Theory

The first cluster of programs represents basics of numerical analysis:
1. The first piece of code, 'RecurrIntegr-Darboux.cpp', demonstrates instability occuring whilst calculating the integral $I_n = \int\limits_{0}^{1} \frac{x^n}{x + 6} dx = \frac{1}{n} - 6 I_{n-1}$ by a direct recurrent method, given that $I_0 = \log\left(\frac{7}{6}\right)$. Namely, calculating $I_{31}$ in such way gives us a cumulative error of order $\approx (-6)\cdot 10^{7}$, which in comparison to the real exact value of $I_{31} \approx 0+$ clearly persuades a courteous reader that this method makes no sense in our case. However, reverse method of calculation $\left( I_{n-1} = \frac{1}{6} \left( \frac{1}{n} - I_n \right) \right)$ quite expectedly turns out to be stable, and, given a value of $I_{62} \approx 0$, chosen for the sake of the number of iterations being the same as in the previous method, one can easily see that it works pretty much precise, yielding us $I_{31} \approx 0.00463$. The last part of this task was to compute the notorious $I_{31}$ by the definition of integral via lower and upper Darboux sums (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux_integral) $s_{31}$ and $S_{31}$, respectively. Of course, being unable to take the actual infinite limit, we will be dealing with the sequence elements close enough to be practically indistinguishable from the actual integral value. Uniform partition of $\left[ 0, 1\right]$ segment by $1000$ parts gives us $s_{31} \approx 0.0044$ and $S_{31} \approx 0.00456$, which is again pretty much what we anticipated it to be.
2. 'Analytic-Numeric-Diff.cpp' exhibits the non-trivial phenomenon of choosing $h$ which stands for the step of numerical approximation for differentiation, i.e. $\frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h}$ instead of the actual analytical value of $f'(x_0)$ . For this purpose an elementary function $f(x) = 7 \sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} + 9 e^{-x} \sin x - \frac{1}{\log^2 x}$ has been chosen, with $x_0 = \pi$ and $f'(x_0) \approx 6.845544$ .
