'Analytic-Numeric-Diff.cpp' exhibits the non-trivial phenomenon of choosing $h$ which stands for the step of numerical approximation for differentiation, i.e. $\frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h}$ instead of the actual analytical value of $f'(x_0)$ . For this purpose an elementary function $f(x) = 7 \sqrt{x^2 + x + 1} + 9 e^{-x} \sin x - \frac{1}{\log^2 x}$ has been chosen, with $x_0 = \pi$ and $f'(x_0) \approx 6.845544$ . The main part of the program constitutes an iterative loop with respect to $h$, on each step making $h$ lower by dividing it by $10$, starting from $h = 1$ and ending on $h = 10^{-20}$ . On each step the error $R_1 = \left| f'(x_0) - \frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h} \right|$ had been calculated, put into a file and then plotted on the plane $h - R_1$ via *gnuplot*. Logarithmic scales were chosen for convenience, as the values vary much in magnitude.
